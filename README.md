Variable: Symbolic name that points to a specific object (we’ll see what objects mean through the article).
Arithmetic operators: Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), integer division (//), modulo (%).
Built-in data types: Numeric (integers, floats, complex), Sequences (strings, lists, tuples), Boolean (True, False), Dictionaries, and Sets.
Boolean expressions: Expressions in which the result is True or False.
Conditional: Evaluates a boolean expression and does some process depending on the result. Handled by if/else statements.
Loop: Repeated execution of code blocks. It can be for or while loops.
Functions: Block of organized and reusable code. You create them with the keyword def.
Arguments: Objects passed to a function. For instance: sum([1, 2, 4])
Run a Python script: Open a terminal or command line and type “python <name of the file>.”
Open a Python Shell: Open a terminal and type python or python3 depending on your system.
  
What Is Object-Oriented Programming in Python?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm in which we can think about complex problems as objects.
  
Object-Oriented programming allows you to reuse code by implementing abstraction. This principle makes your code more concise and legible.
  
1. Abstraction
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism - Polymorphism lets us slightly modify methods and attributes of the subclasses previously defined in the superclass.
4. Encapsulation  - Encapsulation is the process in which we protect the internal integrity of data in a class.
